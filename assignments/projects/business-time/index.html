            <h2>Calisthenics</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Calisthenics is the art of using one's body weight and qualities of inertia as a means to develop one's physique! Calisthenics
                is associated with the rapidly growing international sport called street workout. Street workout as a sport
                consists of athletes competing against one other by each showing their body-weight strength and body-control
                in timed routines to impress a panel of judges. The World Street Workout & Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF)
                based in Latvia orchestrates the annual National Championships in up to 50 different countries (as of 2015)
                and hosts the World Championships for all the national champions to compete at one competition.</p>

            <h2>Yoga</h2>

            <p class="description">
                Improved flexibility is one of the first and most obvious benefits of yoga. During your first class, you probably won't be
                able to touch your toes, never mind do a backbend. But if you stick with it, you'll notice a gradual loosening,
                and eventually, seemingly impossible poses will become possible. You'll also probably notice that aches and
                pains start to disappear. That's no coincidence. Tight hips can strain the knee joint due to improper alignment
                of the thigh and shinbones. Tight hamstrings can lead to a flattening of the lumbar spine, which can cause
                back pain. And inflexibility in muscles and connective tissue, such as fascia and ligaments, can cause poor
                posture.

            <h2>Strength Training</h2>

            <p class="description">
                When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health
                and well-being, including increased bone, muscle, tendon, and ligament strength and toughness, improved joint
                function, reduced potential for injury, increased bone density, increased metabolism, increased fitness and
                improved cardiac function. Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output
                of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment
                to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity, although some proponents
                have adapted it to provide the benefits of aerobic exercise through circuit training.</p>

            <h2>Cardio</h2>

            <p class="description">
                Cardio is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. Aerobic
                literally means "relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen", and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately
                meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. Generally, light-to-moderate intensity activities
                that are sufficiently supported by aerobic metabolism can be performed for extended periods of time. When
                practiced in this way, examples of cardiovascular/aerobic exercise are medium to long distance running/jogging,
                swimming, cycling, and walking, according to the first extensive research on aerobic exercise, conducted
                in the 1960s on over 5,000 U.S. Air Force personnel by Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper.</p>

            <h2>Isometrics</h2>

            <p class="description">
                Simply put, isometrics refer to exercises where the muscles are producing force without movement. This can be achieved by
                either pushing/pulling against an immovable resistance or by holding a weight in a certain position. In both
                cases, the intent is different but the external result is the same. Trying to move a resistance that canâ€™t
                be moved is called overcoming isometrics (you are trying to overcome the resistance), whereas holding a weight
                in place, preventing it from dropping down is called yielding isometrics. Although they look similar, they
                have slightly different training effects. Overcoming isometrics have more transfer to concentric strength
                and are more neurologically demanding. They are best suited for short, very intense efforts and have a greater
                impact on strength than size.

            <h2>Plyometrics</h2>

            <p class="description">
                Plyometrics, also known as "jump training" or "plyos", are exercises in which muscles exert maximum force in short intervals
                of time, with the goal of increasing power (speed-strength). This training focuses on learning to move from
                a muscle extension to a contraction in a rapid or "explosive" manner, such as in specialized repeated jumping.
                Plyometrics are primarily used by athletes, especially martial artists, sprinters and high jumpers, to improve
                performance, and are used in the fitness field to a much lesser degree.</p>
