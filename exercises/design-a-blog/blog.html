        <p class="synbio">Brian Elwin Haner, Jr., better known by his stage name Synyster Gates or simply Syn, is an American musician, best
            known for being the lead guitarist and backing vocalist of the band Avenged Sevenfold. Gates was featured on
            the EP Warmness on the Soul which contains select songs from the first album as well as his new version of "To
            End The Rapture". His name on Avenged Sevenfold's debut album was "Synyster Gates". On the Avenged Sevenfold
            DVD All Excess, Gates claimed that his name was created on a drunken drive through the park with the Rev. Gates
            was voted Sexiest Male in the 2008 Kerrang Readers Poll. In 2010, Guitar World listed him as one of the 30 greatest
            shredders of all time. They described him as being able to perform finger-twisting licks, acrobatic sweeps, devilish
            chromatics and towering dual-harmonies. Gates was chosen as one of Guitar Hero's 50 fastest guitarists. On Guitar
            World's 2010 Readers Poll, Gates was chosen Snappiest Dresser and the Best Metal Guitarist. Rock One Magazine's
            2010 Readers Poll voted Gates the No. 3 best musician in the industry. On April 20, 2011, Gates won the Revolver
            Golden God award for Best Guitarist along with bandmate, Zacky Vengeance. Avenged Sevenfold picked up numerous
            other awards and delivered the headlining performance of the night.[3] In the Special Edition of Revolver magazine
            that was released the same day as the Nightmare album, Gates stated that he originally started out writing the
            song "So Far Away" in honor of his grandfather. However, the song is now primarily about his former bandmate,
            best friend and previous drummer of A7X, the Rev,[4] who died on December 28, 2009.</p>

        <img src="https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20150514/21/assujungah/7d/b9/j/o0338051513307046162.jpg?caw=800" class="nuno"
            height="700" width="450">
        <p class="nunobio">Bettencourt was born on September 20, 1966 in Praia da Vitória, Terceira, Azores, Portugal, to Ezequiel Mendes Bettencourt
            and wife Aureolina da Cunha Gil de Ávila. When he was four years old, his family, including brothers Luís and
            Roberto, moved to Hudson, Massachusetts. Bettencourt lived on Main Street in Hudson for twenty-one years. Initially,
            Bettencourt had little interest in music, preferring to spend his time playing hockey and football. His first
            instrument was the drums and he played them exclusively until his brother, Luís, started teaching him the guitar.
            While Bettencourt was slow to adopt the instrument under his brother's tutelage, his skills quickly developed
            when he began teaching himself, and he has mentioned in many interviews that he would skip many school days to
            practice upwards of seven hours a day. In his sophomore and junior years of high school, Bettencourt dropped
            out of sports so he could focus on playing guitar. He eventually dropped out of high school altogether, for the
            same reason. As a guitarist, one of Bettencourt's earliest influences was Eddie Van Halen. However, as he developed
            his craft as a guitarist and a songwriter, his influences expanded to embrace The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Prince,
            Queen (Brian May), Pat Travers, Paco de Lucía, Al Di Meola and Kayak.</p>
